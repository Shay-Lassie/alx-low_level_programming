malloc allocates a specific number of bytes in memory and returns a void pointer to the first bytes in the block of memory allocated from the heap.
Calloc is similar by=ut takes one more argument
free deallocates the memory assigned and assigns it back to the OP
Valgrind is a debugging tool for memory allocation that ensures the memory previously assigned is freed up
